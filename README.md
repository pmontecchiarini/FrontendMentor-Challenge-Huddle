# Project 1: HTML5, CSS3 (layout with flex)
This project is from the Frontend Mentor coding challanges: Huddle landing page with single introductory section. IÂ´ve used basic CSS, with no preprocessor, in order to showcase my knowledge of the CSS3 and HTML5 basics, which I consider to be essential in mastering front end developing.
